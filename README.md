ðŸš€ Exploring SwiftUI: Working with List Badges ðŸ¦¾

Iâ€™ve been diving into SwiftUI and experimenting with the new List badge functionality. I created a sample project to explore how badge numbers dynamically update based on changing values.

The project features an interactive inbox with a badge that updates as new messages are received, showcasing how to manage badge count and toggle visibility with smooth animations.

Key highlights: ðŸ”¢ Dynamic badge count adjustment ðŸ’¬ Toggle feature with expandable sections ðŸ’¡ SwiftUI's .badge() modifier for list items

Feel free to check out the project and share your thoughts on how you're using badges in your own SwiftUI apps! ðŸš€
